  Probabilistic Models
  --------------------

This is a formalization of probabilistic models in Isabelle/HOL. It builds on
Isabelle's probability theory. The available models are currently Discrete-Time
Markov Chains and a extensions of them with rewards.

As application of these models we formalize probabilistic model checking of pCTL
formulas, analysis of IPv4 address allocation in ZeroConf and a analysis of the
anonymity of the Crowds protocol.

For the PCTL model checking we need the AFP entry Gauss-Jordan-Elim-Fun.
