section {* GHC Version of Mergesort *}

text {*
In the following we show that the mergesort implementation
used in GHC (see \url{http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.0-latest/html/libraries/base-4.3.1.0/src/Data-List.html#sort})
is a correct and stable sorting algorithm. Furthermore, experimental
data suggests that generated code for this implementation is much more
efficient than for the implementation provided by @{theory Multiset}.

descending parts are reversed. Hence, the result is a list of
