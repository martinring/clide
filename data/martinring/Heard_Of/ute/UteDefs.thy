section {* Verification of the \ute{} Consensus Algorithm *}

text {*
  Algorithm \ute{} is presented in~\cite{biely:tolerating}. It is an
  uncoordinated algorithm that tolerates value (a.k.a.\ Byzantine) faults,
  and can be understood as a variant of \emph{UniformVoting}. The parameters
  $T$, $E$, and $\alpha$ appear as thresholds of the algorithm and in the
  communication predicates. Their values can be chosen within certain bounds
  in order to adapt the algorithm to the characteristics of different systems.

  We formalize in Isabelle the correctness proof of the algorithm that
  appears in~\cite{biely:tolerating}, using the framework of theory
  @{text HOModel}.

subsection {* Model of the Algorithm *}

  cardinality that will instantiate the type variable @{text "'proc"}
  of the generic HO model.

  The algorithm proceeds in \emph{phases} of $2$ rounds each (we call
  \emph{steps} the individual rounds that constitute a phase).
  The following utility functions compute the phase and step of a round,
  given the round number.

  If the process receives more than @{text E} votes for @{text v}, it decides
  @{text v}, otherwise it leaves its decision unchanged.

subsection {* Communication Predicate for \ute{} *}

text {*
  Following~\cite{biely:tolerating}, we now define the communication predicate
  for the \ute{} algorithm to be correct.

  The round-by-round predicate stipulates the following conditions:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item no process may receive more than @{text "\<alpha>"} corrupted messages, and
  \item every process should receive more than @{text "max(T, N + 2*\<alpha> - E - 1)"} 
    correct messages.
  \end{itemize}
  \cite{biely:tolerating} also requires that every process should receive more
  than @{text "\<alpha>"} correct messages, but this is implied, since @{text "T > \<alpha>"}
  (cf. lemma @{text alpha_lt_T}).

     \<and> card (SHOrs p \<inter> HOrs p) > T"

text {*
  The global communication predicate requires there exists some phase
  @{text "\<Phi>"} such that:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item all HO and SHO sets of all processes are equal in the second step
    of phase @{text "\<Phi>"}, i.e.\ all processes receive messages from the 
    same set of processes, and none of these messages is corrupted,
  \item every process receives more than @{text T} correct messages in
    the first step of phase @{text "\<Phi>+1"}, and
  \item every process receives more than @{text E} correct messages in the
    second step of phase @{text "\<Phi>+1"}.
  \end{itemize}
  The predicate in the article~\cite{biely:tolerating} requires infinitely
  many such phases, but one is clearly enough.
