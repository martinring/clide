section {* Verification of the \emph{UniformVoting} Consensus Algorithm *}

text {*
  Algorithm \emph{UniformVoting} is presented in~\cite{charron:heardof}.
  It can be considered as a deterministic version of Ben-Or's well-known 
  probabilistic Consensus algorithm~\cite{ben-or:advantage}. We formalize
  in Isabelle the correctness proof given in~\cite{charron:heardof},
  using the framework of theory @{text HOModel}.

subsection {* Model of the Algorithm *}

text {*
  We begin by introducing an anonymous type of processes of finite
  cardinality that will instantiate the type variable @{text "'proc"}
  of the generic HO model.

typedecl Proc -- {* the set of processes *}
arities Proc :: finite

abbreviation
  "N \<equiv> card (UNIV::Proc set)"   -- {* number of processes *}

text {*
  The algorithm proceeds in \emph{phases} of $2$ rounds each (we call
  \emph{steps} the individual rounds that constitute a phase).
  The following utility functions compute the phase and step of a round,
  given the round number.

  vote :: "'val option"    -- {* value the process voted for, if any *}
  decide :: "'val option"  -- {* value the process has decided on, if any *}

  Possible messages sent during the execution of the algorithm, and characteristic
  predicates to distinguish types of messages.

  In step 0, each process sends its current @{text x} value.

  It updates its @{text x} field to the smallest value it has received.
  If the process has received the same value @{text v} from all processes
  from which it has heard, it updates its @{text vote} field to @{text v}.

subsection {* Communication Predicate for \emph{UniformVoting} *}

text {*
  We now define the communication predicate for the \emph{UniformVoting}
  algorithm to be correct.

  The round-by-round predicate requires that for any two processes
  there is always one process heard by both of them. In other words,
  no ``split rounds'' occur during the execution of the algorithm~\cite{charron:heardof}.
  Note that in particular, heard-of sets are never empty.
*}

definition UV_commPerRd where
  "UV_commPerRd HOrs \<equiv> \<forall>p q. \<exists>pq. pq \<in> HOrs p \<inter> HOrs q"

text {*
  The global predicate requires the existence of a (space-)uniform round
  during which the heard-of sets of all processes are equal.
  (Observe that \cite{charron:heardof} requires infinitely many uniform
  rounds, but the correctness proof uses just one such round.)

subsection {* The \emph{UniformVoting} Heard-Of Machine *}

text {*
  We now define the HO machine for \emph{Uniform Voting} by assembling the
  algorithm definition and its communication predicate. Notice that the
  coordinator arguments for the initialization and transition functions are
  unused since \emph{UniformVoting} is not a coordinated algorithm.
