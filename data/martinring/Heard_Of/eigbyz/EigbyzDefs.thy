section {* Verification of the \eigbyz{} Consensus Algorithm *}

text {*
  Lynch~\cite{lynch:distributed} presents \eigbyz{}, a version of
  the \emph{exponential information gathering} algorithm tolerating
  Byzantine faults, that works in $f$ rounds, and that was originally
  introduced in~\cite{bar-noy:shifting-gears}.

  We begin by introducing an anonymous type of processes of finite
  cardinality that will instantiate the type variable @{text "'proc"}
  of the generic HO model.
*}

typedecl Proc -- {* the set of processes *}
arities Proc :: finite

abbreviation
  "N \<equiv> card (UNIV::Proc set)"   -- {* number of processes *}

text {* 
  The algorithm is parameterized by $f$, which represents the number of
  rounds and the height of the tree data structure (see below).
*}

axiomatization f::nat
where f: "f < N"
(* NB: couldn't turn this into a locale, since f is used in the typedef below *)

subsection {* Tree Data Structure *}

text {*
  The algorithm relies on propagating information about the initially proposed
  values among all the processes. This information is stored in trees whose
  branches are labeled by lists of (distinct) processes. For example, the
  interpretation of an entry @{text "[p,q] \<mapsto> Some v"} is that the current
  process heard from process @{text q} that it had heard from process @{text p}
  that its proposed value is @{text v}. The value initially proposed by the process
  itself is stored at the root of the tree.

  We introduce the type of \emph{labels}, which encapsulate lists of distinct
  process identifiers and whose length is at most @{text "f+1"}.

typedef Label = "{xs::Proc list. length xs \<le> Suc f \<and> distinct xs}"

  of the process from which every process receives the correct message.

text {*
  The secure kernel @{text SK} of an entire execution (i.e., for sequences of
  HO and SHO collections) is the intersection of the secure kernels for
  all rounds. Obviously, only the first @{text f} rounds really matter,
  since the algorithm terminates after that.
*}

definition SK :: "(nat \<Rightarrow> Proc HO) \<Rightarrow> (nat \<Rightarrow> Proc HO) \<Rightarrow> Proc set" where
  "SK HOs SHOs \<equiv> {q. \<forall>r. q \<in> SKr (HOs r) (SHOs r)}"

text {*
  The round-by-round predicate requires that the secure kernel at every round
  contains more than @{text "(N+f) div 2"} processes.
*}

definition EIG_commPerRd where
  "EIG_commPerRd HO SHO \<equiv> card (SKr HO SHO) > (N + f) div 2"

text {*
  The global predicate requires that the secure kernel for the entire
  execution contains at least @{text "N-f"} processes. Messages from these
  processes are always correctly received by all processes.
*}

definition EIG_commGlobal where
  "EIG_commGlobal HOs SHOs \<equiv> card (SK HOs SHOs) \<ge> N - f"

text {*
  The above communication predicates differ from Lynch's presentation of
  \eigbyz{}. In fact, the algorithm was originally designed for synchronous
  systems with reliable links and at most @{text f} faulty processes.
  In such a system, every process receives the correct message from at least
  the non-faulty processes at every round, and therefore the global predicate
  @{text EIG_commGlobal} is satisfied. The standard correctness
  proof assumes that $N>3f$, and therefore $N - f > (N + f) \div 2$.
  Since moreover, for any $r$, we obviously have
  \[
   \bigg(\bigcap_{p \in \Pi, r' \in \nat}\!\!\!\! SHO(p,r')\bigg)
   \ \subseteq\ \bigg(\bigcap_{p \in \Pi} SHO(p,r)\bigg),
  \]
  it follows that any execution of \eigbyz{} where $N>3f$ also satisfies
  @{text EIG_commPerRd} at any round. The standard correctness hypotheses thus imply
  our communication predicates.

  However, our proof shows that \eigbyz{} can indeed tolerate more
  transient faults than the standard bound can express. For example, consider the
  case where $N=5$ and $f=2$. Our predicates are satisfied in
  executions where two processes exhibit transient faults, but never fail
  simultaneously. Indeed, in such an execution, every process receives four
  correct messages at every round, hence @{text EIG_commPerRd} always holds.
  Also, @{text EIG_commGlobal} is satisfied because there are
  three processes from which every process receives the correct messages at all
  rounds. By our correctness proof, it follows that $EIGByz_f$ then
  achieves Consensus, unlike what one could expect from the standard correctness
  predicate. This observation underlines the interest of expressing assumptions
  about transient faults, as in the HO model.
