theorem Bondy : 
  assumes "\<forall>A \<in> F. A \<subseteq> X" and "card X \<ge> 1" and "card F = card X"
  shows "\<exists>D. D \<subseteq> X & card D < card X & card (inter D ` F) = card F"
proof -
  from assms(2,3) have "finite F" and "finite X"
    by (metis card_infinite not_one_le_zero)+
  { fix m
    have "m < card F \<Longrightarrow> \<exists>D. D \<subseteq> X & card D \<le> m & card (inter D ` F) \<ge> m + 1"

      with `finite X` have "finite D" by (auto intro: finite_subset)
      show ?case
      proof (cases "card (inter D ` F) = card F")
        case True

        moreover with D `x:X` have "?E \<subseteq> X" by auto
        moreover have "Suc m < card (inter ?E ` F)"
        proof -
