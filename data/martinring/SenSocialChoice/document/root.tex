\section{Overview}

This is a fairly literal encoding of some of Armatya Sen's proofs
\cite{Sen:70a} in Isabelle/HOL. The author initially wrote it while learning
to use the proof assistant, and some locutions remain naive. This work is
somewhat complementary to the mechanisation of more recent proofs of Arrow's
Theorem and the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem by Tobias Nipkow
\cite{Nipkow:2008}.

I strongly recommend Sen's book to anyone interested in social choice
theory; his proofs are quite lucid and accessible, and he situates the
theory quite well within the broader economic tradition.
