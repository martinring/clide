CHANGELOG since afp-2011-1 version

2012-04-19
  Thomas Tuerk:
    Iterators over representations added.

2012-04-18
  Peter Lammich: 
    Merged some theories in common/ subdirectory. 
    Merged OrderedSet into SetSpec, OrderedMap into MapSpec.
    Created xxx_Chapter.thy files to contain the chapter headers.
    Created structured documentation for interfaces and implementations.
  

2012-04-16
  Peter Lammich: Changed directory structure. Created subdirectories 
    impl, gen_algo, and spec. Also renamed 
      AnnotatedListGAPrioImpl -> PrioByAnnotatedList
      AnnotatedListGAPrioUniqueImpl -> PrioUniqueByAnnotatedList
    Moved: HashCode to common/

    INCOMPATIBILITY, only if you access parts of the ICF directly. In most
      cases, just Collections.thy from the main directory should be imported,
      in which case no modifications to importing theories are required.

2012-03-20
  Thomas Tuerk: Further changes to to iterators. INCOMPATIBILITY

  - moved iterator-related theories to subdirectory "iterator"
  - Changed definition of iterators. It is now based on list-iteration.
  - renamed "set_iterator" to "set_iterator_genord"
  - renamed "map_iterator" to "map_iterator_genord"
  - renamed "set_iterator_no_sel" to "set_iterator"
  - renamed "map_iterator_no_sel" to "map_iterator"

2012-03-17
  Thomas Tuerk: Mayor changes to iterators. INCOMPATIBILITY

  - unified iterators for sets, maps
  - argument order of iteratei changed: 
      "iteratei c f m s0" should now be "iteratei m c f s0" 
  - iterate removed
      "iterate f m s0" should now be "iteratei m (lamdba _. True) f s0"
  - type abbreviation "iteratori" remove
      "('s,'x,'state) iteratori" should now be "'s => ('x, 'state) set_iterator"   - type abbreviation "map_iteratori" removed
      "('m,'k,'v,'state) map_iteratori" should now be 
      "'m => ('k x 'v, 'state) set_iterator" 
  - map iterators are now implemented as iterators over key / value pairs.
    As a result, map iterators do not use curried functions any more. Instead the
    function gets a pair as an argument now. Many functions defined in terms of
    map iterators changed their interface as well.
  - several iterators with interruption on lists got unified. They may now have
    slightly different argument orders or paired instead of curried arguments. Most
    noticebly "Assoc_List.iteratei_aux" got replaced by "foldli" (no interface change).
 
2012-02-28
  Peter Lammich: Added indexed array sets (ias,is). 
  Peter Lammich: Changed abbreviations for indexed array map to iam, im (INCOMPATIBILITY)
  Peter Lammich: Added exclude-directive to patterns in StdInst.in.thy, to exclude certain implementations

2012-02-23
  Thomas Tuerk: Added dummy parameter of type unit to empty-operations
    of set and map, to prevent linearity problems with diff-array
    implementations. In the former version, it could happen that the empty
    array was created once and then shared, which results in poor performance.
    INCOMPATIBILITY: Basically, you have to change empty to (empty ()). To exploit
      diff-array based implementations that are only efficient for linear usage, do not
      apply () too early.

  Peter Lammich: Added dummy () parameter to all interfaces. 
    INCOMPATIBILITY, see above

  Peter Lammich: Added indexed array maps (abbreviations iam, i in 
    ArrayMapImpl.thy), that map from natural numbers to values, using 
    an array. They use an exponential growth function, but currently do 
    never shrink again.
