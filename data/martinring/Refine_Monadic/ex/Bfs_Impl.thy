  text {*
    In the @{text "Breadth_First_Search"}-theory, we verified an abstract 
    version of the algorithm. This abstract version tried to reflect the
    given pseudocode specification as precisely as possible.

    However, it was not executable, as it was nondeterministic. Hence,
    we now refine our algorithm to an executable specification, and use
    Isabelle/HOLs code generator to generate ML-code.

    The implementation uses the Isabelle Collection Framework (ICF)
    (Available at \url{http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Collections.shtml}),
    to provide efficient set implementations. We choose a hashset 
    (backed by a Red Black Tree) for the visited set, and lists for
    all other sets. Moreover, we fix the node type to natural numbers.
    *}

  text {*
    The following algorithm is a straightforward rewriting of the 
    original algorithm. We only exchanged the abstract set operations by
    concrete operations on the data structures provided by the ICF.

    The operations of the list-set implementation are named
    @{text "ls_xxx"}, the ones of the hashset are named @{text "hs_xxx"}.

    We first use the partial-correctness code generator of our framework
    to automatically turn the algorithm described in our framework into
    a function that is independent from our framework. This step also
    removes the last nondeterminism, that has remained in the iteration order
    of the inner loop.

    The result of the function is an option type, returning @{text "None"}
    for nontermination. Inside this option-type, there is the option type
    that encodes whether we return with failure or a distance.
