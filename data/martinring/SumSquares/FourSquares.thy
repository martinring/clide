text {* Shows that all nonnegative integers can be written as the sum of four squares. The proof consists of the following steps:
\begin{itemize}\item For every prime $p=2n+1$ the two sets of residue classes $$\{x^2 \bmod p\mid 0\le x\le n\} ~{\rm and}~ \{-1-y^2 \bmod p \mid 0 \le y \le n\}$$ both contain $n+1$ different elements and therefore they must have at least one element in common.
\item Hence there exist $x,y$ such that $x^2+y^2+1^2+0^2$ is a multiple of $p$.
\item The next step is to show, by an infinite descent, that $p$ itself can be written as the sum of four squares.
\item Finally, using the multiplicity of this form, the same holds for all positive numbers.
\end{itemize} *}
