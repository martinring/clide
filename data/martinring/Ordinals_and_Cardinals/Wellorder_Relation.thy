text{* Here we provide induction and recursion principles specific to {\em non-strict} 
well-order relations. 
Although minor variations of those for well-founded relations, they will be useful 
for doing away with the tediousness of 
having to take out the diagonal each time in order to switch to a well-founded relation. *}

subsection {* The notions of maximum, minimum, supremum, successor and order filter  *}


text{* 
We define the successor {\em of a set}, and not of an element (the latter is of course 
a particular case).  Also, we define the maximum {\em of two elements}, @{text "max2"}, 
and the minimum {\em of a set}, @{text "minim"} -- we chose these variants since we 
consider them the most useful for well-orders.  The minimum is defined in terms of the 
auxiliary relational operator @{text "isMinim"}.  Then, supremum and successor are 
defined in terms of minimum as expected. 
The minimum is only meaningful for non-empty sets, and the successor is only 
meaningful for sets for which strict upper bounds exist.  
Order filters for well-orders are also known as ``initial segments". *}
