text {* Shows some properties of the quadratic form $x^2+Ny^2$, such as how to multiply and divide them. The second part focuses on the case $N=3$ and is used in the proof of the case $n=3$ of Fermat's last theorem. The last part -- not used for FLT3 -- shows which primes can be written as $x^2 + 3y^2$. *}
