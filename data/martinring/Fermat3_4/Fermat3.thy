        also have "\<dots> = (-1)^3*a^3 + ?c^3" by (simp only: power_mult_distrib)

      proof (simp only: zgcd1_iff_no_common_primedivisor, clarify)
        fix h::int assume hu: "h dvd u" and "h dvd v" and h: "zprime h"

corollary fermat_mult3:
  assumes xyz: "(x::int)^n + y^n = z^n" and n: "3 dvd n"
  shows "x*y*z=0"
proof -
  from n obtain m where "n = m*3" by (auto simp only: mult_ac dvd_def)
  with xyz have "(x^m)^3 + (y^m)^3 = (z^m)^3" by (simp only: power_mult)
  hence "(x^m)*(y^m)*(z^m) = 0" by (rule fermat3)
  thus ?thesis by auto
