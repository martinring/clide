lemma goal6'1:
  assumes H8: "j'' <= (15 :: int) "
  shows " bit__xor' x'' (bit__xor' y'' z'') = f' j'' x'' y'' z''"
proof -
  from H8 have "nat j'' <= 15" by simp

  shows "bit__or' (bit__and' x'' y'') (bit__and' (4294967295 - x'') z'') = f' j'' x'' y'' z''"
proof -
  from H7 have "16 <= nat j''" by simp
  moreover from H8 have "nat j'' <= 31" by simp
  ultimately show ?thesis
    by (simp add: f_def)

lemma goal8'1:

  assumes H8: "j'' <= 47"
  shows "bit__xor' (bit__or' x'' (4294967295 - y'')) z'' = f' j'' x'' y'' z''"
proof -

proof -
  from H7 have "48 <= nat j''" by simp
