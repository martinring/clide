\title{RIPEMD-160 - Verification of a SPARK/ADA Implementation}
\author{Fabian Immler}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This work presents a verification of an implementation in SPARK/ADA \cite{highintegritysoftware} of the cryptographic hash-function RIPEMD-160. A functional specification of RIPEMD-160 \cite{ripemd} is given in Isabelle/HOL \cite{LNCS2283}. Proofs for the verification conditions generated by the static-analysis toolset of SPARK certify the functional correctness of the implementation. The verification conditions are translated to Isabelle/HOL with a modified version of Victor-0.8.0 \cite{vct}.

\section{Introduction}

The directory \texttt{ada} contains the sourcecode which has been verified
against its specification in Isabelle/HOL (close to its pseudocode definition
from \cite{ripemd}) in the following.  The SPARK-code contains annotations with
so called \emph{proof functions}. The following proof functions(declared in
\texttt{ada/rmd.ads}) are specified in Isabelle/HOL:
\begin{itemize}
\item $bit\_\_and$
\item $bit\_\_or$
\item $bit\_\_xor$
\item $wordops\_\_rotate\_left$
\item $f$
\item $k_l$
\item $k_r$
\item $r_l$
\item $r_r$
\item $s_l$
\item $s_r$
\item $steps$
\item $round$
\item $rounds$
\item $rmd_hash$
\end{itemize}

From the annotations in the SPARK-code, verification conditions were generated
using \emph{SPARK-GPL-2010}(\url{http://libre.adacore.com/libre/download/}):
\texttt{\$spark -vcg -rules=lazy ada/shadow/interfaces.ads ada/wordops.ads
  ada/rmd.ads ada/rmd.adb}

A slightly modified Version of VICTOR \cite{vct} translated these verification
conditions to Isabelle (the results can be found in the theories ending with
$Obligation$ and $Declaration$)\footnote{There are some slight superficial
differences between the original translated files and the ones included here,
in order to conform to current Isabelle practice}. Definitions for the
roof-functions are given in the theories with the suffix $Specification$ and the
proofs are given in the theories ending in $User$.
