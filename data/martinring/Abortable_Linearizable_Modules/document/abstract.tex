We define the Abortable Linearizable Module automaton (ALM  for short) and
prove  its  key  composition   property  using  the  IOA  theory  of
HOLCF. The  ALM is at  the heart of the  Speculative Linearizability
framework.  This framework  simplifies devising  correct speculative
algorithms by enabling  their decomposition into independent modules
that  can  be  analyzed  and  proved correct  in  isolation.  It  is
particularly useful when working in a distributed environment, where
the  need  to  tolerate  faults  and  asynchrony  has  made  current
monolithic protocols so intricate that  it is no longer tractable to
check their correctness.  Our theory contains a typical example of a
refinement proof in the I/O-automata framework of Lynch and Tuttle.
