(* NOTES for sequents, had to prove a few lemmas to import the permutation stuff from the HOL lib. The few lemmas easily prove A <~~> B for typical A and B by reducing to element counts. This also fixes a todo in Permutation.thy - we can reduce perms to counts, and multisets could already be reduced to counts. Thus A <~~> B = (multiset_of A = multiset_of B) is easy. *)
