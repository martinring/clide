{"name":"clide","tagline":"A web interface for the interactive theorem prover Isabelle.","body":"### What is clide?\r\n\r\nClide is a web interface for the interactive theorem\r\nprover Isabelle. It uses latest web technology and the Isabelle/PIDE\r\nframework to implement a web-based interface for asynchronous proof\r\ndocument management that competes with, and in some aspects even\r\nsurpasses, conventional user interfaces for Isabelle such as Proof General\r\nor Isabelle/jEdit.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n- State of the art HTML5 interface\r\n- Server-side syntax highlighting\r\n- Editable mathematical notation\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n- The interface is not optimized yet for tablet devices.\r\n- User management is rudementary and has bugs. It is currently beeing completely redesigned.\r\n- File management is also rudementary and beeing redesigned. This will also include hyperlinking to definitions.\r\n- If the internet connection is lost, the session can't be restored right now. This will also be addressed in the redesign.\r\n- Unfortunately right now it can happen, that inconsistencies in the server-synced highlighting occur. In these cases please refresh the page.\r\n\r\n### Live demo\r\n\r\nPlease use a current WebKit-Based Browser (Google Chrome, Apple Safari or recent Opera) and visit:\r\n\r\n[http://clide.informatik.uni-bremen.de](http://clide.informatik.uni-bremen.de)\r\n\r\n### Setup local server\r\n\r\nTo set up your on experimental server just follow these simple steps:\r\n\r\n- Make sure Isabelle 2012 is installed on your machine and `ISABELLE_HOME` environment variable is set.\r\n- Install *play! webframework* Version 2.1 or later\r\n- Clone the clide repo\r\n  ```\r\n  > git clone https://github.com/martinring/clide.git\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Start the server\r\n  ```\r\n  > cd clide\r\n  > play start\r\n  ```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
