The Isabelle font has been assembled with FontForge
(http://fontforge.sourceforge.net), composing glyphs from existing
(free) fonts: Bluesky TeX fonts (scaled 222%) and Bitstream Vera Mono,
with some additions from DejaVu Sans Mono and DejaVu Sans.

Computer Modern PostScript Fonts
(Adobe Type 1 format)
2001/06/06

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The PostScript Type 1 implementation of the Computer Modern fonts produced by
and previously distributed by Blue Sky Research and Y&Y, Inc. are now freely
available for general use. This has been accomplished through the cooperation
of a consortium of scientific publishers with Blue Sky Research and Y&Y.
Members of this consortium include:

        Elsevier Science
        IBM Corporation
        Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)
        Springer-Verlag
        American Mathematical Society (AMS)

In order to assure the authenticity of these fonts, copyright will be held
by the American Mathematical Society. This is not meant to restrict in any
way the legitimate use of the fonts, such as (but not limited to) electronic
distribution of documents containing these fonts, inclusion of these fonts
into other public domain or commercial font collections or computer
applications, use of the outline data to create derivative fonts and/or
faces, etc. However, the AMS does require that the AMS copyright notice be
removed from any derivative versions of the fonts which have been altered in
any way. In addition, to ensure the fidelity of TeX documents using Computer
Modern fonts, Professor Donald Knuth, creator of the Computer Modern faces,
has requested that any alterations which yield different font metrics be
given a different name.

The fonts have a generous copyright, allowing derivative works (as
long as "Bitstream" or "Vera" are not in the names), and full
redistribution (so long as they are not *sold* by themselves). They
can be be bundled, redistributed and sold with any software.

The fonts are distributed under the following copyright:
