                        Pure: The Pure Isabelle System


This directory contains the ML source files for Pure Isabelle, which
is the basis for all object-logics.  The Isabelle/Pure image may be
compiled in batch mode like this:

  isabelle make Pure

Developers may want to produce a RAW image that merely consists of the
ML compiler with the compatibility setup of ML-Systems/ preloaded:

  isabelle make RAW

Now the Pure session may be compiled interactively as follows:

  isabelle tty -l RAW
  use "ROOT.ML";
