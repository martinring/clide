<H1>Protocol-Independent Secrecy Results</H1>

<P>The current development is built above the HOL (Higher-Order Logic)
Isabelle theory and the formalization of protocols introduced by <A
HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/">Larry Paulson</A>.  More details are
in his paper <A
HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/papers/Auth/jcs.pdf">
The Inductive approach
to verifying cryptographic protocols</A> (J. Computer Security 6, pages
85-128, 1998).

<P>
This directory contains a number of files:

<UL>
<LI>Extensions.thy contains extensions of Larry Paulson's files with many useful
lemmas.

<LI>Analz contains an important theorem about the decomposition of analz
between pparts (pairs) and kparts (messages that are not pairs).

<LI>Guard contains the protocol-independent secrecy theorem for nonces.
<LI>GuardK is the same for keys.
<LI>Guard_Public extends Guard and GuardK for public-key protocols.
<LI>Guard_Shared extends Guard and GuardK for symmetric-key protocols.

<LI>List_Msg contains definitions on lists (inside messages).

<LI>P1 contains the definition of the protocol P1 and the proof of its
properties (strong forward integrity, insertion resilience, truncation
resilience, data confidentiality and non-repudiability)

<LI>P2 is the same for the protocol P2

<LI>NS_Public is for Needham-Schroeder-Lowe
<LI>OtwayRees is for Otway-Rees
<LI>Yahalom is for Yahalom

<LI>Proto contains a more precise formalization of protocols with rules
and a protocol-independent theorem for proving guardness from a preservation
property. It also contains the proofs for Needham-Schroeder as an example.
