essentially by omitting everything but classes.
The type system and semantics of this language
(and a corresponding abstract Machine $micro$JVM)
are formalized in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL.
Type safety both of $micro$Java and the $micro$JVM
are mechanically verified.

To make the paper self-contained, it starts with
introductions to Isabelle/HOL and the art of
embedding languages in theorem provers.},

full subset of sequential Java, which we call Java_light. In particular, 
we present solutions to challenging features like exception handling, 
static initialization of classes and dynamic binding of methods.

This axiomatic semantics has been proved sound and complete w.r.t. 
our operational semantics of Java_light, described in earlier papers.
To our knowledge, our Hoare logic is the first one for an
object-oriented language that has been proved complete.
The proofs also give new insights into the role of type-safety.

All the formalization and proofs have been done with the 
theorem prover Isabelle/HOL.},
