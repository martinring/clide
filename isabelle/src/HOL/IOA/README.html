<h3>IOA: A basic formalization of I/O automata in HOL</h3>

Author:     Konrad Slind, Tobias Nipkow and Olaf M&uuml;ller<br>
Copyright   1995,1996 Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen

<p>

This directory contains a formalization of the meta theory of I/O automata in HOL.
This formalization has been significantly changed and extended.  The new version
is available in the subdirectory HOLCF/IOA.  There are also the proofs of two
communication protocols which formerly have been here.
