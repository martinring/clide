Isabelle Verification of the Alternating Bit Protocol by 
combining IOA with Model Checking

-------------------------------------------------------------

Correctness.ML contains the proof of the abstraction from unbounded
channels to finite ones.

Check.ML contains a simple ModelChecker prototype checking Spec against 
the finite version of the ABP-protocol.
