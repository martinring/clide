text {*
  Higher-order quotients are defined over partial equivalence
  relations (PERs) instead of total ones.  We provide axiomatic type
  classes @{text "equiv < partial_equiv"} and a type constructor
  @{text "'a quot"} with basic operations.  This development is based
  on:

  Implementation in Isabelle HOL.}  Elsa L. Gunter and Amy Felty,

subsection {* Partial equivalence *}

text {*
  Type class @{text partial_equiv} models partial equivalence
  relations (PERs) using the polymorphic @{text "\<sim> :: 'a => 'a =>
  bool"} relation, which is required to be symmetric and transitive,
  but not necessarily reflexive.
*}

class partial_equiv =
  fixes eqv :: "'a => 'a => bool"    (infixl "\<sim>" 50)
  assumes partial_equiv_sym [elim?]: "x \<sim> y ==> y \<sim> x"
  assumes partial_equiv_trans [trans]: "x \<sim> y ==> y \<sim> z ==> x \<sim> z"

text {*
  \medskip The domain of a partial equivalence relation is the set of
  reflexive elements.  Due to symmetry and transitivity this
  characterizes exactly those elements that are connected with
  \emph{any} other one.

subsection {* Equivalence on function spaces *}

text {*
  The @{text \<sim>} relation is lifted to function spaces.  It is
  important to note that this is \emph{not} the direct product, but a
  structural one corresponding to the congruence property.
