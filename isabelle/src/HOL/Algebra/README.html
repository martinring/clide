<H1>Algebra --- Classical Algebra, using Explicit Structures and Locales</H1>

This directory contains proofs in classical algebra.  It is intended
as a base for any algebraic development in Isabelle.  Emphasis is on
reusability.  This is achieved by modelling algebraic structures
as first-class citizens of the logic (not axiomatic type classes, say).
The library is expected to grow in future releases of Isabelle.
Contributions are welcome.

<H2>GroupTheory, including Sylow's Theorem</H2>

<P>These proofs are mainly by Florian Kamm&uuml;ller.  (Later, Larry
Paulson simplified some of the proofs.)  These theories were indeed
the original motivation for locales.

Here is an outline of the directory's contents: <UL> <LI>Theory <A
HREF="Group.html"><CODE>Group</CODE></A> defines semigroups, monoids,
groups, commutative monoids, commutative groups, homomorphisms and the
subgroup relation.  It also defines the product of two groups
(This theory was reimplemented by Clemens Ballarin).

<LI>Theory <A HREF="FiniteProduct.html"><CODE>FiniteProduct</CODE></A> extends
commutative groups by a product operator for finite sets (provided by
Clemens Ballarin).

<LI>Theory <A HREF="Coset.html"><CODE>Coset</CODE></A> defines
the factorization of a group and shows that the factorization a normal
subgroup is a group.

<LI>Theory <A HREF="Bij.html"><CODE>Bij</CODE></A>
defines bijections over sets and operations on them and shows that they
are a group.  It shows that automorphisms form a group.

<LI>Theory <A HREF="Exponent.html"><CODE>Exponent</CODE></A> the
	    combinatorial argument underlying Sylow's first theorem.

<LI>Theory <A HREF="Sylow.html"><CODE>Sylow</CODE></A>
contains a proof of the first Sylow theorem.
</UL>

<H2>Rings and Polynomials</H2>

<UL><LI>Theory <A HREF="CRing.html"><CODE>CRing</CODE></A>
defines Abelian monoids and groups.  The difference to commutative
      structures is merely notational:  the binary operation is
      addition rather than multiplication.  Commutative rings are
      obtained by inheriting properties from Abelian groups and
      commutative monoids.  Further structures in the algebraic
      hierarchy of rings: integral domain.

<LI>Theory <A HREF="Module.html"><CODE>Module</CODE></A>
introduces the notion of a R-left-module over an Abelian group, where
	R is a ring.

<LI>Theory <A HREF="UnivPoly.html"><CODE>UnivPoly</CODE></A>
constructs univariate polynomials over rings and integral domains.
	  Degree function.  Universal Property.
</UL>

<H2>Legacy Development of Rings using Axiomatic Type Classes</H2>

<P>This development of univariate polynomials is separated into an
abstract development of rings and the development of polynomials
itself. The formalisation is based on [Jacobson1985], and polynomials
have a sparse, mathematical representation. These theories were
developed as a base for the integration of a computer algebra system
to Isabelle [Ballarin1999], and was designed to match implementations
of these domains in some typed computer algebra systems.  Summary:

<P><EM>Rings:</EM>
  Classes of rings are represented by axiomatic type classes. The
  following are available:

<PRE>
  ring:		Commutative rings with one (including a summation
		operator, which is needed for the polynomials)
  domain:	Integral domains
  factorial:	Factorial domains (divisor chain condition is missing)
  pid:		Principal ideal domains
  field:	Fields
</PRE>

  Also, some facts about ring homomorphisms and ideals are mechanised.

<P><EM>Polynomials:</EM>
  Polynomials have a natural, mathematical representation. Facts about
  the following topics are provided:

<MENU>
<LI>Degree function
<LI> Universal Property, evaluation homomorphism
<LI>Long division (existence and uniqueness)
<LI>Polynomials over a ring form a ring
<LI>Polynomials over an integral domain form an integral domain
</MENU>
