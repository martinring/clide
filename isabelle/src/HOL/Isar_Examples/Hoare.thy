subsection {* Primitive Hoare rules *}

text {* From the semantics defined above, we derive the standard set
  of primitive Hoare rules; e.g.\ see \cite[\S6]{Winskel:1993}.
  Usually, variant forms of these rules are applied in actual proof,
  see also \S\ref{sec:hoare-isar} and \S\ref{sec:hoare-vcg}.

  \medskip The \name{basic} rule represents any kind of atomic access
  to the state space.  This subsumes the common rules of \name{skip}
  and \name{assign}, as formulated in \S\ref{sec:hoare-isar}. *}

theorem basic: "|- {s. f s : P} (Basic f) P"
proof
  fix s s' assume s: "s : {s. f s : P}"
  assume "Sem (Basic f) s s'"
  then have "s' = f s" by simp
  with s show "s' : P" by simp
qed

text {*
 The rules for sequential commands and semantic consequences are
 established in a straight forward manner as follows.
*}

theorem seq: "|- P c1 Q ==> |- Q c2 R ==> |- P (c1; c2) R"
proof
  assume cmd1: "|- P c1 Q" and cmd2: "|- Q c2 R"
  fix s s' assume s: "s : P"
  assume "Sem (c1; c2) s s'"
  then obtain s'' where sem1: "Sem c1 s s''" and sem2: "Sem c2 s'' s'"
    by auto
  from cmd1 sem1 s have "s'' : Q" ..
  with cmd2 sem2 show "s' : R" ..
qed

theorem conseq: "P' <= P ==> |- P c Q ==> Q <= Q' ==> |- P' c Q'"
proof
  assume P'P: "P' <= P" and QQ': "Q <= Q'"
  assume cmd: "|- P c Q"
  fix s s' :: 'a
  assume sem: "Sem c s s'"
  assume "s : P'" with P'P have "s : P" ..
  with cmd sem have "s' : Q" ..
  with QQ' show "s' : Q'" ..

text {* The rule for conditional commands is directly reflected by the
  corresponding semantics; in the proof we just have to look closely
  which cases apply. *}

theorem cond:
  assumes case_b: "|- (P Int b) c1 Q"
    and case_nb: "|- (P Int -b) c2 Q"
  shows "|- P (Cond b c1 c2) Q"
proof
  fix s s' assume s: "s : P"
  assume sem: "Sem (Cond b c1 c2) s s'"
  show "s' : Q"
  proof cases
    assume b: "s : b"
    from case_b show ?thesis

      from s nb show "s : P Int -b" by simp

text {* The @{text while} rule is slightly less trivial --- it is the
  only one based on recursion, which is expressed in the semantics by
  a Kleene-style least fixed-point construction.  The auxiliary
  statement below, which is by induction on the number of iterations
  is the main point to be proven; the rest is by routine application
  of the semantics of \texttt{WHILE}. *}

theorem while:
  assumes body: "|- (P Int b) c P"
  shows "|- P (While b X c) (P Int -b)"
proof
  fix s s' assume s: "s : P"
  assume "Sem (While b X c) s s'"
  then obtain n where "iter n b (Sem c) s s'" by auto
  from this and s show "s' : P Int -b"
  proof (induct n arbitrary: s)
    case 0
    then show ?case by auto
  next
    case (Suc n)
    then obtain s'' where b: "s : b" and sem: "Sem c s s''"
      and iter: "iter n b (Sem c) s'' s'" by auto
    from Suc and b have "s : P Int b" by simp
    with body sem have "s'' : P" ..

subsection {* Concrete syntax for assertions *}

text {* We now introduce concrete syntax for describing commands (with
  embedded expressions) and assertions. The basic technique is that of
  semantic ``quote-antiquote''.  A \emph{quotation} is a syntactic
  entity delimited by an implicit abstraction, say over the state
  space.  An \emph{antiquotation} is a marked expression within a
  quotation that refers the implicit argument; a typical antiquotation
  would select (or even update) components from the state.

  We will see some examples later in the concrete rules and
  applications. *}

text {* The following specification of syntax and translations is for
  Isabelle experts only; feel free to ignore it.

  While the first part is still a somewhat intelligible specification
  of the concrete syntactic representation of our Hoare language, the
  actual ``ML drivers'' is quite involved.  Just note that the we
  re-use the basic quote/antiquote translations as already defined in
  Isabelle/Pure (see @{ML Syntax_Trans.quote_tr}, and
  @{ML Syntax_Trans.quote_tr'},). *}

subsection {* Rules for single-step proof \label{sec:hoare-isar} *}

text {* We are now ready to introduce a set of Hoare rules to be used
  in single-step structured proofs in Isabelle/Isar.  We refer to the
  concrete syntax introduce above.

  \medskip Assertions of Hoare Logic may be manipulated in
  calculational proofs, with the inclusion expressed in terms of sets
  or predicates.  Reversed order is supported as well. *}

  in HOL \cite{Naraschewski-Wenzel:1998:HOOL}.  For any record field
  $x$, Isabelle/HOL provides a functions $x$ (selector) and
  $\idt{x{\dsh}update}$ (update).  Above, there is only a place-holder
  appearing for the latter kind of function: due to concrete syntax
  \isa{\'x := \'a} also contains \isa{x\_update}.\footnote{Note that
  due to the external nature of HOL record fields, we could not even
  state a general theorem relating selector and update functions (if
  this were required here); this would only work for any particular
  instance of record fields introduced so far.} *}

  verification conditions.  It is important to note that the method
  requires \texttt{WHILE} loops to be fully annotated with invariants
